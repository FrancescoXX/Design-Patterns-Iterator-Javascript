# Iterator Design Pattern 
### *Also known as Cursor*
___

## Behavioral Design Pattern

## ⚡️Recognize 

We want to separate the logic of how to access data from data itself
___

## 💡Intent

Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially, without exposing its representation
___


## 🔧 Apply when

We want give a way to access elements in such a way that it does not expose its internal structure;
The Iterator takes the responsibility for access and manipulation of the data structure
___

## ✅Pro

- We can define different iterators for different ways of manipulating a data structure
- Clients can use an iterator to access data without knowing the representation
___

## 🏆 Great for

Decoupling algorithms from containers
